## Development

#### Large Files | Git LFS

Since Git cannot handle files larger than 100mb, this repository uses [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) (Large File Storage). Please see the [documentation](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Tutorial) for more information.

We have used a generic `.gitattributes` file that holds a variety of common game development file types that LFS will handle. If a file type is not being handled properly, please see `.gitattributes` to see whether the proper file extension is included or not. Add if necessary.
